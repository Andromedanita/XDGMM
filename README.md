# XDGMM
This is a Python class for using Gaussian mixtures to do density estimation of noisy, heterogenous, and incomplete data using extreme deconvolution (XD) algorithms which is compatible with the scikit-learn machine learning methods. It implements both the [astroML](http://www.astroml.org/index.html) and [Bovy et al. (2011)](https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution) algorithms, and extends the BaseEstimator class from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

## XDGMM Algorithms
The code currently supports the [astroML](http://www.astroml.org/index.html) algorithm for XDGMM fitting and sampling. The [Bovy et al. (2011)](https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution) algorithm will be implemented.

## Machine Learning
This class is compatible with cross validation methods from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
